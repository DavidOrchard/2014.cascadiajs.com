##Abstract

In the last 4 months, I have incrementally converted both green-field and already-shipping Backbone.js+Handlebars+Rails
web applications to use React. This talk contains practical, hard-won advice on how we did this with a very small team 
while still delivering features to our thousands of users at a sustainable pace.
